        <p class="text-3">At Yale, I completed the joint major in Computer Science and Economics, a major in Mathematics, and a Certificate in Data Science.</p>
        <p class="text-2">My favorite Computer Science courses included <i>Algorithms, Systems Programming & Computer Organization </i> and <i>Advanced Computational Intelligence for Games</i>. </p>
        <p class="text-2">I took quite a few interesting classes in Mathematics, such as <i>Real Analysis, Abstract Algebra </i> and <i>Extremal Combinatorics</i>. </p>
        <p class="text-2">In Economics, I enjoyed <i>American Economic History, Mathematical Game Theory</i> and <i>Applied Econometrics in Politics and Sports</i>. </p>
        <p class="text-2">I also completed a courses of Statistics, such as <i>Stochastic Processes, Advanced Probability</i> and <i>Machine Learning</i>. </p>

        <p class="text-5">Notable Projects</p>
        <p class="text-2">For my Senior Project, I trained a Neural Network in Tensorflow to help play the card game Hearts. I also analyzed the performance of Information Set Monte Carlo Tree Search in the game of Hearts.</p>
        <p class="text-2">In <i>Systems Programming & Computer Organization</i>, I implemented malloc using brk, sbrk system calls on basic operating system, allocating physical memory to virtual memory.</p>
        <p class="text-2">In addition, I also implemented a basic bash shell using syscalls.</p>
        <p class="text-2">I'm also particularly proud of my work in <i>Applied Econometrics</i>, where I looked at the impact of the 2020 Hong Kong National Security Law on politically connected firms.</p>

        <p class="text-5">Undergraduate Learning Assistant (ULA) work</p>
        <p class="text-3">I was also invited to work as an ULA for two classes Iâ€™ve taken at Yale. As a ULA, I organized office hours, graded exams or problem sets and taught a weekly discussion group section to a class of 20 students.</p>
        <p class="text-2"><b>Introductory Machine Learning (Prof. John Lafferty)</b></p>
        <p class="text-1">The course <i>covered Linear regression and classification, tree-based methods, clustering, topic models, word embeddings, recurrent neural networks, dictionary learning and deep learning.</i></p>
        <p class="text-2"><b>Algorithms (Prof. Andre Wibisono)</b></p>
        <p class="text-1">The course covered <i>Paradigms for algorithmic problem solving: greedy algorithms, divide and conquer, dynamic programming, and network flow. NP completeness and approximation algorithms for NP-complete problems.</i></p>

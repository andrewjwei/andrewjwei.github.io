			<p class="text-5">Hi – I’m Andrew!</p>
			<p class="text-3">I’m a recent Yale graduate with a major in Computer Science, Economics and Mathematics, along with a Certificate in Data Science. Currently, I work as a Junior Trader at Akuna Capital.</p>
			<p class="text-3">I’m passionate about a lot of things – ranging from quantitative disciplines such as finance, computer science, economics and mathematics to qualitative topics like international relations and history. As a result, I’ve spent time working in a variety of fields: I’ve conducted financial research on Indian solar energy firms, analyzed medical data using a predictive machine learning model and analyzed the American national debt in a historical context. Although my past experiences may be seemingly unrelated, they show that I thrive at tackling complex problems in a systematic manner.</p>
